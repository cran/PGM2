Description: Implements recursive construction methods for balanced incomplete block designs (BIBDs), their second generation, resolvable BIBDs (RBIBDs), and uniform designs (UDs) derived from projective geometries over GF(2). It enables extraction of nested structures in multiple stages and supports recursive resolution processes, as introduced in Boudraa et al. (2013).
